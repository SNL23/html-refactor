# Horiseon Marketing

## Description

This webpage was created to infrom users about the search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.I build this project so it would have a codebase that follows accessibility standards. I gave all the div tags a semantic HTML elements. I gave all the images an accessible alt attribute. I made sure all the heading attributes fell in sequential order. Finally, I gave it a concise and descriptive title. In this project I learned new HTML semantic elements. I also learned different ways to consolidate CSS selectors.
